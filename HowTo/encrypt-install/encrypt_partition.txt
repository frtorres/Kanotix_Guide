=============================

1. Install LUKS/crypt-setup
      apt-get install cryptsetup


2. Setup your LUKS Partition
      cryptsetup --verbose --verify-passphrase luksFormat /dev/sdXN

      cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md2 mylukspartition

You can change "mylukspartition" to whatever you would like to call it, it just controls the name created in /dev/mapper which is the device you will use to mount the encrypted LUKS partition.
You'll find that the above command creates "/dev/mapper/mylukspartition"


3. CREATE the filesystem on the LUKS device
      mkfs.ext3 /dev/mapper/mylukspartition

Mount the LUKS Partition

      mkdir /mnt/luks
      mount /dev/mapper/mylukspartition /mnt/luks

      cryptsetup luksClose /dev/mapper/mylukspartition


umount -l /mnt/sdX for a race conditioin happenning (device busy error)

Notes (Kano):
1. you have to use gpt
   just dont format one partition with gparted
   leave it empty and use cryptsetup with it

2. cryptsetup -c aes-xts-plain -s 512 luksFormat /dev/sdX1
3. cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdX1 luks
4. mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/luks 
   like that
