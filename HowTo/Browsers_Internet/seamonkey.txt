Download 64 bit version from:

https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/seamonkey/releases/2.29/contrib/seamonkey-2.29.en-US.linux-x86_64.tar.bz2

Default download is a 32 bit version, got problems: Couldn't load XPCOM 

see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=829604

To install

1. Download the binaries as suggested. Extract it in /opt , which is usually the best place for statically compiled stuff, or if you must, somewhere like /usr/local/mozilla

# cd /opt
# wget https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/seamonkey/releases/2.26.1/linux-i686/en-US/seamonkey-2.26.1.tar.bz2
# tar jxvf seamonk*
# cd seamonk*
# ln -s /opt/seamonkey/seamonkey /usr/local/bin/seamonkey

You should then be able to run it from the cli as a user e.g.
Code:

$ seamonkey
