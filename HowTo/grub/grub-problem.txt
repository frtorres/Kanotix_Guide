=============================

If you have a kanotix/linux install on other partition:

if you update the kernel in another install, you boot the default install,then

    update-grub and reboot

but that grub can boot every other install

if there is a kernel update problem is only in OTHER installs. then you reboot. without any other selection and run in that install

update-grub

then you reboot and can select the new kernel for the other install

thats the way it was for ages and will be the default install you want. boot it then 

grub-install /dev/sda

when you only have got 1 hd
