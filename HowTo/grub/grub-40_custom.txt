1. Open the grub local customization file in an ASCII editor (as root!): “/etc/grub.d/40_custom”. We will add our custom entry here, and afterwards we run “grub-update” to update the GRUB2 bootmenu.
    To the bottom of that file, add these lines (mind the backslashes – you should remove them, they are only added for better readability on this blog page):

2 insert  menuentry “Customized Grub Option” {
    }

3.  Run “update-grub2” to re-generate the Grub master configuration.
    If you get a “update-grub: command not found” error, that is easily fixed. In some distro’s the “update-grub” script was added, and some others like Slackware do not have it. The content of that “update-grub” script is:

    #!/bin/sh
    set -e
    exec grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg "$@"

    You can easily create a new file “/sbin/update-grub” as root, copy the above lines into it, and after saving this file you run “chmod +x /sbin/update-grub” to make the script executable.

    Note that there may be distributions that rename “grub-mkconfig” to “grub2-mkconfig”. In that case, adjust the contents of your new “update-grub” script accordingly.

After rebooting your Linux computer you will see “Customized Grub Option” as a new selectable option in your GRUB boot menu. Select that, and watch your computer boot into Slackware Live Edition.
