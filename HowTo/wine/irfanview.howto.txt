1. Install "wine" on your system.
2. Get the file "mfc42.dll" from the folder "C:\windows\system32" of a running Windows system.
3. Copy this file to the analogous wine folder "/home/username/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32".
4. Download the setup file (e.g. iview400_setup.exe) for IrfanView (www.irfanview.com This website is available in english and german)
5. Click with the right mouse button on the downloaded file and choose the option "Open with 'wine'"

Testing Irfanview 4.4.2

1. Seems that dll is zero sized on Win10.

FIX, run this: winetricks mfc42

2. Download zip with plugins 64 bits and place the whole plugin32 under plugin dir at .wine/Drive....

** move content not dir!.
