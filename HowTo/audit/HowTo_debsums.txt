debsums --generate=missing,keep

checking against md5sums in /var/lib/dpkg/info/

Verify installed packages and report only errors.
sudo debsums -s

Verify every installed package and report only changed files.
sudo debsums -c




Notes:

You can use

dpkg -V <package>

I test it and it works also on configuraton files.
