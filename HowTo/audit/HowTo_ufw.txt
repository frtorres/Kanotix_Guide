    Convienient Syntax: ufw allow 22 or ufw allow ssh is all that is required to allow inbound ssh traffic if your default policy is DENY.

    Easy Logging: ufw logging on will turn on fairly reasonable logging. The nice thing about the logging is that by default it drops particularly noisy services (port 137 anyone?).

    Ability to implement complicated policies: On my home machine I use ufw and am currently running a fairly complicated policy.

    Ability to add your own iptable rules. Pretty much any policy can still be implemented with ufw even if the default interface doesn't provide a mechanism because you can always add your own rules.

    Great Documentation: man ufw is often all you need to solve some problem or answer some question--which is great if you are setting up your firewall when offline.

This is not a "click one button and you will be secure" firewall. 


At the end of the day what it really does is provide an easy to use rule-creation syntax, some abstraction around iptables-save and iptables-restore and brings some default rules and practice that a newbie might not know about
