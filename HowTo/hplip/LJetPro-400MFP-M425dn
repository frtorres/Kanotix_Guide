=============================================

1. Installed hplip sw ok, but to scan images a propietary plugin was required.2

Got this error, running hp-plugin

"hplip-3.16.9-plugin.run file does not match its checksum. File may have been corrupted or altered"


2. Visit: 
https://www.openprinting.org/download/printdriver/auxfiles/HP/plugins/

and download proper version plugin, in kanotix distro as today:

https://www.openprinting.org/download/printdriver/auxfiles/HP/plugins/hplip-3.16.9-plugin.run

3. Choose to load manual and skip warning about .asc file to check validity.
