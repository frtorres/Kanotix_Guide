=============================

1.- Recommendations:
ssh for low speed
vnc for highspeed

2.- for a router you need port forward 22 tcp to the linux box in the router

3.- the other just /etc/init.d/ssh restart

4. and you connect using: ssh root@ip for just console use you can run screen and the other ones runs then: screen -x

to watch you
but you cant run X apps
basically you could using ssh -X but thats terribly slow
and vnc? is it used to run X applications?
that works really bad over slow connections
i use that only when the speed is reasonable fast
to show where to click ;)
sometime i just use it to configure the router and acess then via ssh
ssh is much faster as not graphical
with less than 512 kbit upload you can basically forget it

do you have got 2 pcs at home?
!vnc

"vnc" could be (#1) apt-get install xtightvncviewer, or (#2) vncviewer -encodings corre -listen, or (#3) apt-get install x11vnc, or (#4) x11vnc -connect helper-ip, or (#5) forward 5500 TCP needed for helper (on default port), or (#6) http://www.heise.de/netze/tools/fernwartung, or (#7) for dialup-connections use: vncviewer -bgr233 -encodings corre -listen

is the other way
on your pc, the helper pc, you do first
apt-get remove --purge vnc-java
I have 3.

then you install what is mentioned at point 1
run as USER then
vncviewer -bgr233 -listen
the -bgr233 converts truecolor to 8 bit, makes it faster

with lan you may not need it
on the other pc you run
x11vnc -connect your-ip
when you want do do that from outside you need a tcp 5500 forward to your helper ip
with slow connections this is really unstable
and even on fast ones you have to restart sometimes
but that way you can use listen mode
that means the other one does not need to configure the router

but that requires portforwarding on the server side

<frtorres> ok I will give a try for your feedback later
btw. vnc is not encrypted
not ideal to transfer passwords
in most cases i let the local user type em
irc is not enc too, so usally best would be using a temp account for ssh
and change pw later again
but basically noone does ;)
best is to disable ssh and only start on purpose
also you should configure dyndns in your router
then you can do: x11vnc -connect your-dyndns-name

or put that into a script, maybe with a killall -9 x11vnc; x11vnc -connect whateve
r
listen mode goes thru any firewall
at least on the side of the user who needs help

on your side you need of course port 5500 tcp
basically you could change that port too, but some apps will calc the used port relatively to 5500, thats a bit confusing

as USER - do not run as root
do not install packages with flash or swf in the name, if you did: remove em!
because that causes conflicts with the plugin in your home!
 do refer to apt-get install *-fash?
flash 9 works fine with that combination
perfect kano. Thanks a lot for your help
 good night
<frtorres> bye
