you should use that from time to time, if I removed packages from the repo
run that script and reboot

you can always remove a repo and run it again. will downgrade the packages
sometimes i have to remove some packages from the repo, then you get the default ones with it

like if you remove the mesa repo it would downgrade

you might need
apt-get autoremove --purge
remove-orphans
apt-get clean
