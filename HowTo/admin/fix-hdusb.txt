=============================

fix a partition used by OS. Mounted cannot be fixed so a live install is needed.

1. reboot now to a live system
2. what you do then is fsck -f /dev/sda2
3. well before sudo -i then
   fsck -f /dev/sda2
   mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
   cd /mnt/media
   then use mc to delete all dirs + files exept the sda1 dir
   remote the .mtab-hal too
4. then boot hd if you are lucky it works again. if not, no idea what is wrong on your pc
