=============================

1.  so the fix is: clean up fstab from all usb drive entries!
when you do:  mount -a
with no usb drive attached remove em, so that mount -a does not show any error
then usb drives will work fine

2. Only when you put the kanotix iso the preffered way onto usb drive it is excluded from fstab

3. in it would be: chkdsk /f X:
if you have it here thats possible or using linux you use
    fsck -r /dev/sdb1
