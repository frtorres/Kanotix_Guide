1. To see service status:
service --status-all

2. To view how long each process took to start, run this command:

systemd-analyze blame


3. To view all available unit files on your system:

systemctl list-unit-files

4. To list all failed units:
systemctl --failed

5. To view a list of enabled and disabled services:

systemctl list-unit-files --type=service

6. Use the systemctl enable command to have systemd automatically start a service (or other type of unit) at bootup. The systemctl disable command disables a services and stops it from starting automatically with your computer.

systemctl enable name.service

systemctl disable name.service

7. You can “mask” a service or other unit to prevent it from starting up at all. You’ll need to unmask it before it can start in the future:

systemctl mask name.service

systemctl unmask name.service
