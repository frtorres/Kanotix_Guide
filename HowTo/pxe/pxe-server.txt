=============================

1. If you have got more than 1 pc available, you can configure a server with static ip.

2. Disable dhcp in the router

3. Change values for ip/network settings in

http://kanotix.com/files/fix/ipxe/simple-pxe-server-single.sh

and by default you get a boot menu that allows you to boot memtest (after 10s)
but you can also set the servername then you can boot just like you did with the customized ipxe variant. You just dont need that.

It has got already a sample option for sanboot (over iscsi) but i did not write a howto how to use that yet.
