=============================

apt-get remove --purge $(deborphan)

source: http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/tech-tip-removing-unnecessary-packages-debian-systems

If you get:

"deborphan: The status file is in an improper state.
One or more packages are marked as half-installed, half-configured,
unpacked, triggers-awaited or triggers-pending. Exiting."

then:

    dpkg --configure -a

Before identify what happend but DO NOT proceed unless you know what you are doing...


    aptitude purge ~c

Or as an alternative to show problematic packages:

egrep '^Status: |^Package: ' /var/lib/dpkg/status | egrep -B 1 'half-installed|half-configured|unpacked|triggers-awaited|triggers-pending'
