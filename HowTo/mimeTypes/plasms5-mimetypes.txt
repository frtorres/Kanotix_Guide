---------------------------------------

Apply for Midnight Commander and other programs.

Hint: Use of xdg-utils for systemwide.
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xdg-utils#xdg-open

1. apt-get install xdg-utils
2. Steps to manage

2.1. Determine a file's MIME type:

       $ xdg-mime query filetype photo.jpeg
         image/jpeg

2.2. Determine the default application for a MIME type:

       $ xdg-mime query default image/jpeg
         gimp.desktop

2.3. Change the default application for a MIME type:

       $ xdg-mime default feh.desktop image/jpeg

It is important to detect, find and invoque properly XX.desktop application



2.4. Debug default application for MIME type:

$ env XDG_UTILS_DEBUG_LEVEL=10  xdg-mime query default text/html


3. See this: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/77136/xdg-open-default-applications-behavior/107508#107508

to check how to identify and use .desktop file for step 2.3

        $ locate -i foo.desktop to verify that foo.desktop exists

I had problems setting a new default for video files.


5. Finally.
-----------

From Plasma5 or from command line change filetype associatons.

       $ kcmshell5 filetypes

Worked ok.

Anyway there are 3 options for video.. To be analized how priority is handled as
vlc was giving some problems with current kernel


6. mimeTypes for Firefox.

see: https://alien.slackbook.org/blog/make-firefox-understand-downloaded-files/

6.1 - Stop firefox if it is running
6.2.- Delete or rename the mimetypes cache (where firefox keeps its file association settings):
    $ rm ~/.mozilla/firefox/<yourprofile>/mimeTypes.rdf
6.3.  Start firefox again
6.4.  Download any file if you had not done this before

Open that file from the “Tools > Downloads” menu (by right-clicking on it and selecting “Open“). When asked to choose the application for opening the fike, browse to “/usr/bin/xdg-open“. then check the checkbox to “Remember your choice“.



7. Other hints.
---------------

Midnight commander has it own file assignments in
       ~/.config/mc/ini
BUT no handling defined for

current associations COULD be at: $HOME/.local/share/applications/defaults.list
but seems is not aligned with


The .desktop files can be found in /usr/share/applications/ or you can create your own files under $HOME/.local/share/applications/. To find out the mime type of the files, run

file --mime-type <some_file>
