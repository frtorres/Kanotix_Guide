=============================

swap of stick is still miserably lame
have grub on the stick?
not normal

dd if = / dev / sdb count = 1 | strings

stands grub?
or as wise as you have to install grub to sda
can try the same command also times with / dev / sda
that goes only as root

mbr of sda?
well check it all the time

strange when the boot is not, grub does not even come?

2.- U3:

is the stick with U3?
ie simultaneously with dvd?
sudo-i
apt-get update
apt-get install u3-tool
u3-tool-D / dev / sdc

let's see
after
! Paste
then show just fdisk-l
of the stick
there too

can also fdisk-ul
for usb it with / sbin / fdisk-l
as user
get along?
aha

dd if = / dev / sdc count = 1 | strings

stands grub
naja 5th line may be too
check other times dei
you have grub on the wrong board I think times
probiers with sdb to sda or with sudo
I can later - now I'm using dvd on - catch up?
yes, if you have provided to xp hd should also re-NEN "normal" slip on mbr
either NEN syslinux mbr
or fixmbr from xp cd and boot in recovery mode
from cd so it would go with
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install syslinux

sudo dd if = / usr / lib / syslinux / mbr.bin of = / dev / sda
if it is on sda
checks stop times
or have it installed in the root partition?
then if it were to sdc2
somewhere must be dug, find it out where
it can normally only sdb, sda or sdc2 be
well as many opportunities are still ned
with sudo in front
yes
where isses now sdc2?
then'd have to put only one boot flag
without digging one can not install normal
've checked sdc2?

you're chroot ned in
or did not properly applied, effectively doing just
mount / dev/sdc2 / mnt
and then

for x in sys proc dev, Thu mount - bind / $ x / mnt / $ x; done
chroot / mnt
update-grub
grub-install - recheck / dev / sdc
exit

for x in sys proc dev, Thu umount / mnt / $ x; done
umount / mnt
but you?
missing something because when you dolphin?
