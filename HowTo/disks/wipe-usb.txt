1. dd

Zero-fill the disk by writing a zero byte to every addressable location on the disk using the /dev/zero stream. iflag and oflag as below will try to disable buffering, which is senseless for a constant stream. 

# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX iflag=nocache oflag=direct bs=4096

Or the /dev/urandom stream:

# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdX bs=4096

The process is finished when dd reports, No space left on device: 

2. shred

See Core utilities#shred.

The following command invokes shred with its default settings and displays the progress.

# shred -v /dev/sdX

Alternatively, shred can be instructed to do only one pass, with entropy from e.g. /dev/urandom.

# shred --verbose --random-source=/dev/urandom -n1 /dev/sdX

3. Badblocks

For letting badblocks perform a disk wipe a destructive read-write test has to be done.

# badblocks -c 10240 -wsv /dev/<drive>
