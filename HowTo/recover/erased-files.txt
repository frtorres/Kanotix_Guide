1. as root 

apt-get install foremost

2. Use foremost
foremost -a -d -v -T -t all -i /dev/hda1 -o /tmp/foremost

Without the "-T" flag this works for me. I'm not sure you need the "-d" flag too.

check -t option to recover specific file types.

It is disk consuming.. -o generates a foremost-DDDMMMM dir at destination.

Tested to recover files from a msd card (android)
