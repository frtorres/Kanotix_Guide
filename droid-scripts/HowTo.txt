if you happen to use Terminal Emulator for Android app. It allows a widget which can be used to execute a script.

    choose Term Shortcut widget in your current launcher.

    Corresponding to Arguments enter:

    sh <FILEPATH>

    In my case, the query was:

    sh  /sdcard/airdroid/dd.sh

    As for the root access, you can either provide su access from inside the script and use the aforesaid command for execution, or do:

    su -c "sh  /sdcard/airdroid/dd.sh"
