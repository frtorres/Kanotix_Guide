2.- When you booted it via efi, then you need a gpt or primare fat partition in case you want to install it /boot/efi

3.- If you dont have got  a primary partition, then use gdisk and convert your hd to gpt. gdisk is not preinstalled.

4.- As you can not got back that easy, before you use it do:
    dd if=/dev/sda of=backup.mbr count=1
