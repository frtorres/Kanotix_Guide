=============================


Question, I'm thinking on trying kanotix for my pen drive, to substitute knoppix which is "old". So I want to try acritox's daily builds (based on jessie), but I can't find the difference between "normal" kde images and "special" images. Any idea what's the difference?

Not that I'm sure yet if I want to go with kde over lxde, but I wonder what the diff is

<Kano> :
special has xbmc preinstalled and vbox and binary drivers in gfxdetect modee and the steam client.

Last question, would Kanotix be able to read/use a knoppix persistence image?

<Kano>: no

and it is no file. you dd the image and enable persistence.
on reboot you have got persictence active.

kanotix has no knoppix code inside, but is based on debian live.

So it's a partition?

it will be automacticallly created and a config file written the file will have got the last times used boot options in it.

btw. best would be using utc on every system, even windows on the boxes you run the stick
!timefix :  "timefix" could be http://kanotix.com/files/fix/Timefix.zip

contains a windows reg file to do that. you can add timezone override via bootoption.

The problem is, if you let kanotix shutdown it will most likely update your system clock to utcon a hd install you could just run: dpkg-reconfigure tzdata and then fix-time -l to enforce local time

thats why i would suggest to install it, it can be installed onto usb hd too
new systems need gpt, fat32 300 mb in case you boot with efi (checked with: sudo efibootmgr -v)
and ext4 for linux itself
