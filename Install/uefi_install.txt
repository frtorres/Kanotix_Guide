1. Inside windows 8: 

use powercfg -h off

as admin cmd and disable secure boot

2. Install in efi mode

mount the fat partition over /boot/efi

3. efibootmgr -v

4. you rebootet using win shift reboto? then the ntfs partition is most likely in suspend
in win use powercfg -h off

5. gpt has no limit to primary partitions. All partitions are prim√§re

just resize but disable hibernat fire first.
you have unlmited primary partitions with gtp
