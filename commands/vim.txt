Cut and Paste to internal clipboard:
-------------------------------------
Position the cursor where you want to begin cutting.
Press v to select characters, or uppercase V to select whole lines, or Ctrl-v to select rectangular blocks (use Ctrl-q if Ctrl-v is mapped to paste).
Move the cursor to the end of what you want to cut.
Press d to cut (or y to copy).

"+y

or

or ESC :set clipboard=unnamed

Back to Normal mode (Press escape[esc]), press y to copy.

1. Removes BOM of UTF8 files <U+FEFF> Unicode Character 'ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE' (U+FEFF)
-----
# vim file_name
# Remove all BOM characters:
:set nobomb
# Save the file:
:wq
-----
OR
-----
vim -b fileName

Now those "hidden" characters are visible (<feff>) and can be removed.

1.-  error- opening a root owned file with another sudo account

    For some reason the file you are writing to cannot be created or overwritten.
    The reason could be that you do not have permission to write in the directory
    or the file name is not valid.

    :w !sudo tee % > /dev/null

    will save the file.

1.- HELP

Vim has a builtin help system, I just quoted what it says to :h E212.
