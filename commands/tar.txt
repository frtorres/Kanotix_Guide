=============================

tar -zxvf <filename>.tar.gz

Download to a directory such as /user/downloads or something. 
start another session as root. 
Then you generally (in the console) tar -zxvf filename.tar.gz paying attention to case. 
Then, cd to the directory you need to compile the program in then ./configure then make then make install then exit. 
Then you can run the program from the command line in the usr session. 

When using the tar command given above, make sure that the -f option is the last one on the list before the file name. 
One thing different about the tar command is that the dash before the options is optional.

There are two commands that you will probably use in the future where the command letter does not use a dash but the options do. These are the rar and par commands.

for rar:
rar x -kb filename.rar will extract the files preserving subdirectories. The -kb option will keep broken (partial) files. Adding a dash before the x will not work.
