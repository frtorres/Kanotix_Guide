-----------------------


I was getting 

I had to recompile the driver
intel-oss-test.sh

<Kano> now the defaut is without SNA
ok OSS now
<Kano> grep UXA /var/log/Xorg.0.log
<Kano> if you want SNA:
<Kano> wget -O /etc/X11/xorg.conf http://kanotix.com/files/fix/oss-test/xorg.conf.intel.sna
<Kano> screen /etc/init.d/kdm restart
<Kano> grep SNA /var/log/Xorg.0.log


<Kano> you had sna with the other driver
<Kano> sna is faster
	If I got problems, then I can revert to oss with the script I run ok?
<Kano> the script deletes the xorg.conf
<Kano> what it does is to compile the latest intel ddx driver
<Kano> maybe i package a new one


[16:46:32] <Kano> you did not activate sna
[16:46:42] <Kano> that would restart x
